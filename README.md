# 🚀 Python Data Science Portfolio: 3-in-1 Analytics Showcase

Welcome to my project repository! This collection showcases my journey through data manipulation, market analysis, and open-source contribution patterns using Python and its powerful ecosystem.
 
 # 📽️ Project 1: Netflix Movie Duration Analysis
"Is the average duration of movies on Netflix declining?" Inspired by the evolution of Netflix from a DVD service to a streaming giant, this project dives into movie trends from 2011 to 2020.
* Key tasks: * Constructed a Python dictionary from scratch for historical duration data (103 mins in 2011 down to 90 mins in 2020).
* Transformed raw data into Pandas DataFrames for deeper inspection.
* Goal: Validating the hypothesis of shrinking movie lengths using data visualization.

# 📱 Project 2: Google Play Store Market Analysis
"Strategies for Growth and Retention in the Android App Market." An extensive analysis of over 10,000 apps to understand what makes an app successful in a crowded marketplace.
* Datasets Used: * apps.csv: Detailed features of 10,000+ apps.
* user_reviews.csv: Sentiment analysis (Positive/Negative/Neutral) of user feedback.
* Key Insights: * Categorical distribution of apps.
* Sentiment Polarity and Subjectivity analysis to drive user retention strategies.
* Identifying lucrative niches in the Google Play ecosystem.

# 🛠️ Project 3: Scala Open Source Ecosystem Insights
"Mining 10 years of development history from Git and GitHub." Scala is a powerhouse for Data Science. This project analyzes 30,000+ commits to identify the key influencers and experts behind the language.
* The Data Pipeline:
* Merged multiple datasets spanning from 2011 to 2018 (pulls_2011-2013.csv & pulls_2014-2018.csv).
* Linked pull requests with modified files (pull_files.csv).
* Key Findings: * Identified the most active contributors.
* Visualized the development pulse of the Scala community over a decade.

# 💻 Tech Stack Used
* Languages: Python, Scala (Analysis context)
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub
